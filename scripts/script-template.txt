<INSTRUCTIONS>
Use the <CODEBASE> code as reference, and convert the high-level <TASK> and <TASK_FROM_TASKS_MD> into a set of very detailed step-by-step instructions that an AI coding agent can complete.
Only includes steps an AI coding agent can take. Do not include testing or any other work a human would do to confirm the task has been completed.
When the agent's work is complete, ALWAYS have the agent run a build with `npm run build` and check for errors. If there are errors, the agent should attempt to fix them. If there are no errors, the agent should indicate that the task is complete.
Be specific and decisive about what the agent should do.
Do not include any additional meta instructions to the user. Use markdown formatting.
